# Cylinder Reminder Cap
This project was born of having to replace welding cylinders frequently because valves were being left open and the gas would eventually escape; this would be discovered by the next person to use the welder and they'd be mighty upset.

I teach people who are welding to put the cap on the cylinder after they open it; because of its color and shape it does a good job of being a visual reminder to close the valve when done welding. 

I have tested the final version on a variety of different cylinders and regulators, but depending on yours and your use case, you may have to scale it to fit properly.

## Files
* `cylinder-open.scad` - The [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) file that I created the cap with. Uses [text\_on\_OpenSCAD](https://github.com/brodykenrick/text_on_OpenSCAD). 
* `cylinder-cap-with-supports.stl` - STL file generated from OpenSCAD
* `cylinder-cap-with-supports-slic3r.gcode` - gcode for the Prusa i3 mk2 printer
